OpenScadModules

Useful and training OpenScad Modules

The original idea came from CloneWars Spain where Obijuan (https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JuanGonzalezGomez/posts) 
is teaching us OpenScad using MicroVideoTutorials on Youtube.

The main purpose is to create useful modules and learn from other people coding styles.
